              <p class="main_text">The largest swamp in Lithuania, in the territory of Dzūkija National Park.
                Located south of Marcinkonys village and north of Kotra River,
                 which flows along the Belarus-Lithuania border in this area.
                 The area of the swamp is protected as a natural reserve.

                      undisturbed nature in Lithuania, an area of 11,212 hectares, and it is protected in the Čepkeliai reservation,
                      which was established in 1975 and since 1993 has been a Ramsar (wetlands-preservation) site.

                        <p class="main_text">Čepkeliai consists not only of the largest Lithuanian raised bog (an area of 5,858 hectares),
                           but also of lowland sedge bogs and black alder swamps, dry Cladinoso-callunosa forest, bog islands and lakes.
                            Wolves and lynxes, black grouse and Western Capercaillie (wood grouse),
                            the yellow lady’s slipper and Eastern pasqueflower (Pulsatilla patens): these are only a few of the more than 4,000 species of animals and plants found in the area.

                     <p class=" main_text"> During the summer, the Lithuanian lynx has a relatively short, reddish or brown coat,
                       which tends to be more brightly coloured in animals living at the southern end of its range. In winter,
                       however, this is replaced by a much thicker coat of silky fur that varies from silver-grey to greyish brown.
                       The underparts of the animal, including the neck and chin, are white at all times of the year.
                       The fur is almost always marked with black spots, although the number and pattern of these are highly variable.
                        Some animals also possess dark brown stripes on the forehead and back.
                        Although spots tend to be more numerous in animals from southern populations,
                        Lithuanian lynx with heavily spotted fur may exist close to others with plain fur</p>
